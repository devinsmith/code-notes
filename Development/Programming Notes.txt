pointer/reference          object           4/8       Depends on whether 32/64 bit platform

VALUE TYPES: have automatic storage, stored on stack/register
REFERENCE TYPES: have dynamic storage, stored on heap, accessed through references/pointers
STATIC TYPES: have static storage, stored in fixed seperate memory/data segment
OBJECTS: Instances of a class
POD TYPES: primitive variables, pointers, unions, arrays of POD types, structs/classes of POD types

LOCAL SCOPE: Variable defined in a block
GLOBAL SCOPE: Variable defined outside a block, can be in a namespace
CLASS SCOPE: Member Variables in a class
FUNCTION PROTOTYPE SCOPE: Variables in function prototype
PUBLIC/EXTERNAL LINKAGE: Can be accessed accross files
PRIVATE/INTERNAL LINKAGE: Can only be accessed by file declared in

UNARY OPERATOR: Act on single values
BINARY OPERATOR: Act on two values
TERNARY OPERATOR: Act on three values

DEEP COPY: A complete copy, underlying memory of all references/pointers duplicated
SHALLOW COPY: A shared copy, references/pointers all point to same location
TRIVIALLY COPYABLE: Can copy with memcpy; not types that have deep copy/hidden pointers
TRIVIALLY RELOCATABLE: Can move with memcpy; not types that self refer (pimpl with ptr back to parent)

COPY-ON-WRITE / IMPLICIT SHARING
• Objects share the same memory in a 'shared block' if have the same values
• Automatically detaches the object from a shared block when object changes and ref count is > 1
• Can be dangerous for iterators when container detaches from shared block

DECLARING VARIABLES
• Determines how much memory is needed for a data object
• Determines how the bits in memory are interpreted 
• Determines what methods can be performed using the data object
• Statically typed languages require variable type to be defined

NAMING CONVENTION
• Characters usable: alphabet, numbers, underscore character
• The first character in a name cannot be a numeric digit.
• You can’t use a keyword for a name.
• Names beginning with __ or _ are reserved for use by the compiler
• Camel notation: myVariable
• Pascal notation: MyVariable

TYPE-SAFETY
• How much compiler will check that you don't mix incompatible variables
• Eg. C++ prevents floating point being added to string

TYPE-CAST / EXPLICIT CONVERSION
• Data may be lost, done by user with cast operator
• base -> derived
• double -> float -> long -> int -> short
• unsigned -> signed

AUTOMATIC / IMPLICIT CONVERSION
• Bool is converted to int internally
• No data is lost, auto done by compiler
• Can interfere with overload resolution and silently let incorrect code compile
• derived -> base
• short -> int -> long -> float -> double
• signed -> unsigned

OPERATORS / ESCAPED CHARACTERS
::   Scope resolution operator
\n   Newline
\t   Horizontal tab
\b   Backspace
\\   Backslash
\'   Single quote
\"   Double quote
\r   Return
\0   Null character

ORDER OF EXPRESSION EVALUATION
• Known as short-circuiting logical expressions
• Order is left to right where right is only done if left is true: if(left && right)
• Doesn't work with bitwise operators

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// PROGRAM EXECUTION
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) PREPROCESSOR
• Accepts Source code, Outputs Source code
• Removes comments and # directives

2) COMPILER
• Accepts Source code, Outputs machine/assembly/object code
• Mangles C++ function names as it has function overloading
  using extern "C" or compiling in C will prevent the mangling

3) LINKER
• Accepts machine code, Outputs machine code in form of executable
• Links together your code with any external libraries

COMPILE TIME: Action performed during compilation; uses no execution time.
RUN TIME: Action performed during program execution

OPCODE: single executable machine language instruction
OPERANDS: arguments given after the opcode
MNEMONICS: set to equal an opcode or a series of opcodes/operands

===============================================================================================================
CPU MEMORY LOCATIONS
===============================================================================================================

REGISTERS
• Physical Temporary storage for processing data/calculations taken from cache
• ESP: STACK POINTER REGISTER: Always points to the top of the stack
• EBP: STACK BASE POINTER REGISTER: Pointer to data on the stack. 
• EAX: ACCUMULATOR REGISTER: Primarly used for mathematical operations
• EBX: BASE REGISTER: Pointer to data in a segment register
• ECX: COUNTER REGISTER: Counter for string and loop operations
• EDX: DATA REGISTER: Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations
• ESI: SOURCE REGISTER: Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations
• EDI: DESTINATION REGISTER: Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations
• FLAGS REGISTER: Reports on the status of the program being executed
• IP (INTRUCTION POINTER) REGISTER: Contains a pointer to the next intruction to be executed

CACHES
• Physical Temporary storage for frequently accessed data for rapid access taken from RAM
• No processing on data- must be moved to registers if this is needed
• Cache Miss: Failed attempt to read/write to the cache resulting in RAM access
• Organised into levels L1, L2, L3 in order of decreasing speed and increasing size
• When data is requested, a whole cache line is fetched
• Cache line size typically 32 or 64 bytes, number of cache lines depends on kb size of cache
• Cache lines organised into sets with each set having a set number of assigned lines
• Each cache line knows what physical memory addresses it corresponds to
• Temporal Locality: Memory faster to access again once fetched into cache
• Spatial Locality: Memory stored together is fetched together reducing amount of fetches
• Three common types:
    - Data (D-cache): caches data
    - Instruction (I-cache): caches instructions
    - Translation lookaside buffer (TLB): improves virtual address translation speed

RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM)
• Physical Main memory where everything is held for execution
• Virtual memory is memory on hard drive extending RAM

===============================================================================================================
RAM MEMORY LOCATIONS
===============================================================================================================

SEGMENTS 
• Sections of memory used for various purposes
• Segmentation Fault: Attempt to access RAM location that the CPU cannot physically access

INITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (GLOBAL/STATIC)
• Contains global/static values that have storage allocated at startup

INITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (CONST DATA)
• Contains const data and string literals whose values are known at compile time
  (eg. const char* a = "b", the "b" is stored in the segment, the a is stored on the stack)
• All data read-only and modifying it is undefined behaviour due to optimizations
• Segmentation fault caused if trying to write to const data

UNINITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (BSS)
• Contains zero-initialised data

THE STACK
• LIFO Segment storing temporary/local/value-type variables and keeps track of program execution
• Each function called has a 'Stack Frame' containing local variables until the function returns
• Contains memory address of next instruction to execute after the called function returns
• Self manages memory; variables allocated and freed automatically, no fragmentation
• Has limit on size, Fast access
• Operations on objects are usually faster
• Stack overflow caused if large stack allocation or recursion gone wrong

THE HEAP
• Segment storing dynamically allocated reference-type variables
• User allocates memory; memory may become fragmented
• Larger size than stack though slower as it uses pointers to access
• Doesn't actually use a heap structure, can be based off queue
• Operations on objects are usually slower
• Heap used by malloc/free and placement new, Free store used by new/delete
• Free Store may be the Heap or a seperated area so new/delete and malloc/free can't be interchanged
• Segmentation fault caused if accessing memory after its deleted

===============================================================================================================
DEBUG MEMORY ALLOCATION
===============================================================================================================

• Debug uses more memory than release to store guard bytes/information about allocated memory
• Guard bytes are used to detect buffer overruns/underruns
• Freed memory is set to 0xDD (Dead Memory) to detect dangling pointers
• Newly allocated memory is set to 0xCD (Clean Memory) to determine uninitalised variables

0xABABABAB : Guard bytes used by HeapAlloc() after allocated heap memory
0xFDFDFDFD : Guard bytes used by C++ Debugging Heap before and after allocated heap memory
0xFEEEFEEE : Freed heap memory used by HeapFree()
0xDDDDDDDD : Freed heap memory
0xCCCCCCCC : Uninitialised stack memory, used by C++ debugging runtime library
0xCDCDCDCD : Uninitialised heap memory, used by C++ debugging runtime library
0xBAADF00D : Uninitialised heap memory, used by LocalAlloc(LMEM_FIXED)
0xABADCAFE : A startup to this value to initialize all free memory to catch errant pointers
0xBADCAB1E : Error Code returned to the debugger when connection is severed to the debugger
0xBEEFCACE : Used by NET as a magic number in resource files
0xDEADDEAD : Microsoft Windows STOP Error code used when the user manually initiates the crash
0xc0000005 : Exception Code Access Violation, accessing an null pointer

IS-A RELATIONSHIP
• Class inherits an interface + implementation for non pure virtual functions
• Public inheritance

HAS-A RELATIONSHIP

• C run-time libraries detect an error and request program termination

EXCEPTION NEUTRAL
• Exceptions thrown should be propagated unchanged to the objects's caller

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: BASIC
• Failures/exceptions might alter program state
• No leaks occur and affected objects are still usable but not in predictable state

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: STRONG
• Failures/exceptions guarantee program state is unchanged
• No leaks occur and objects and iterators not affected

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: NOTHROW
• Failure and exceptions do not happen
