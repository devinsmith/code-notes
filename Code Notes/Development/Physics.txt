KINEMATIC EQUATIONS
=============================================================================

Can only be used when accerlation (a/aᶜ/α) is constant

x   displacement

i:(1,0), j:(0,1) then g is -
i:(1,0), j:(0,-1) then g is +

=============================================================================
FORCE(F)
=============================================================================

F = ma          forces acting on object
Fᶜ = maᶜ        centripetal force
N = mgcosӨ      force from surface onto object
Fr = µN         friction acting on object

∑F = F + Fr + mgcosӨ

NEWTON'S LAWS
1) Every body remains in a state of rest or uniform motion(constant velocity) 
   unless it is acted upon by an external unbalanced force.

2) A body of mass subject to a force undergoes an acceleration that has the 
   same direction as the force [F = ma]

3) The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal, 
   opposite and collinear.

=============================================================================
ENERGY(E)
=============================================================================

NON-ISOLATED SYSTEM:
 ∆E = W + Q 
 W = ∆KE + ∆GPE + ∆SPE + ∆TE

ISOLATED SYSTEM: 
 ∆E = W = ∆KE + ∆GPE + ∆SPE + ∆TE = 0
 ∆KE = ¹/₂m(v(f)² - v(0)²)

KE = ¹/₂mv²
GPE = mgh
SPE = Spring Potential energy (will be 0 in perfectly elastic collisions)
TE = Thermal energy due to friction
Q = Energy due to heating of system

ENERGY TRANSFER: WORK(W)
Energy is transferred from the environment into the system
W = τӨ
W = F.d             when d is alligned with force
W = ‖F‖‖d‖cosӨ      when d isn't alligned with force
                    want component of force in direction of d

W(overall) = ∆E
W(KE) = ∆KE
W(GPE) = ∆GPE

ENERGY TRANSFER: HEAT(Q)
Energy is transferred from the system back into the environment

=============================================================================
MOMENTUM(p)
=============================================================================
p = mv

force is rate of change of momentum:
    F = ma = m(dv/dt) = d(mv)/dt = dp/dt

MULTIPLE OBJECTS/PARTICLES IN SYSTEM:
P = overall momemtum of whole system
P = p₁ + p₂ + ...

∆p₁/∆p₂ = change of momentum of indivdual object after the collision
∆P = ∆p₁ + ∆p₂ = 0 overall momentum in system doesn't change

--------------------------------------------
   P = Pᶠ = P° as ∆P = 0
   m₁v₁(f) + m₂v₂(f) = m₁v₁(0) + m₂v₂(0)
--------------------------------------------

EG(1):
Perfectly elastic collision where initial momemtum P of whole system is 0
Object 1 hits object 2 which is stationary. Define one direction as positive

Before Collsion       After Collision
p₁(0) = x             p₁(f) = 0
p₂(0) = 0             p₂(f) = x

Due to perfectly elastic collision, all momemtum is transferred from one
object to another during collision. If both objects are moving, add one
object's momemtum to other to make one object virtually start from rest

∆p₁ = -x
∆p₂ = x
where  ∆P = ∆p₁ + ∆p₂ = 0
Impulse from 1 onto 2 = ∆p₂ = x
Impulse from 2 onto 1 = ∆p₁ = -x

The impulse put on an object is equal to ∆p of the object

=============================================================================
IMPULSE(J)
=============================================================================
J = F.dt = dp = ∆p = pᶠ-p° = m∆v = m(vᶠ-v°)

    F = dp/dt
►   dp = F.dt
►   J = dp = ∆p

=============================================================================
TORQUE(τ)
=============================================================================
F = Force applied to point
R = vector from Point to origon of object
α = angular acceleration produced by torque
i = moment of inertia of the point

τ = iα

=============================================================================
ANGULAR MOMENTUM(L)
=============================================================================
p = momentum
R = vector from Point to origon of object
i = moment of inertia of the point
w = Angular velocity

L = R X p = iw

torque is rate of change of angular momentum:
    τ = iα = i(dw/dt) = d(iw)/dt = dL/dt

=============================================================================
ANGULAR VELOCITY(w) / ANGULAR ACCERLATION(α)
=============================================================================
s = speed of rotation
Ө = amount rotated around axis
n̂ = axis of rotation/normal to the area of the rotation

ɸ = Өn̂
w = sŵ = sn̂ = dӨ/dt
α = dw/dt = d²Ө/dt²

MOTION
=============================================================================
For a block sliding down a hill with a pushing force:
  F = ma
  N = mgcosӨ
  Fr = µN
  where ∑F = F + mgsinӨ + Fr

=============================================================================
SPRINGS: HOOKE'S LAW
=============================================================================
The force on m, due to the spring:              Fs(t) = -kx(t)
The force on m, due to friction and surface:    Fr(t) = -µv(t)
Total force on m:                               F(t) = Fs(t) + Fr(t)

If there is outside input:                      u(t)
Total force on m:                               F(t) = Fs(t) + Fr(t) + u(t)

u(t): user input force
v(t): velocity of mass
x(t): displacement from initial displacement Xo
k: spring constant
µ: friction coeffeciant

=============================================================================
BALLISTICS/PROJECTILES
=============================================================================
A projectile is shot at angle Ө where up is positive j, right positive i
No air resistance so i component of velocity doesn't change

  v = initial speed
  a = 0i - 9.8j
  v(0) = vcosӨi + vsinӨj
  v(f) = vcosӨi - vsinӨj
  v(f/2) = vcosӨi + 0j
  d = dˣi + dʸj

  at t = 0 and t = f: dʸ = 0 as the projectile is on the ground
  at t = f/2 the projectile is at it's highest height but slowest speed

  d = v(0)t + (1/2)at²
    = t(v(0) + (1/2)at)  let d = 0 using y components

  ► 0 = t(vʸ(0) + (1/2)(-9.8)t)
  ► 0 = t /or/ 0 = vʸ(0) + (1/2)(-9.8)t
  ► t(0) = 0 /or/ t(f) = 2vʸ(0)/9.8

  to find total distance travelled (dˣ) sub t(f) into:
  dˣ = v(0)ˣt + (1/2)aˣt²

ANGULAR VELOCITY = w
LINEAR VELOCITY = v
TANGENTIAL VELOCITY = vᵀ
TRANSLATIONAL VELOCITY = vᵗ

Angular velocity is velocity around the rotation axis
Tangential velocity is velocity in direction of rotation circle
Linear velocity is sum of tangential velocity (if rotating) and translational 
velocity of whole body (if translating)

RIGHT-HAND RULE:
Curl fingeres in direction object is rotating
Stick thumb up; Thumb is in direction of w

=============================================================================
POINT/BODY ROTATING AROUND AN AXIS
=============================================================================
no change in body's orientation

2D RELATIONS: when axis of rotation is about i,j or k
 -------------------
| vᵀ(t) = w(t)x(t)  |
| aᶜ(t) = w(t)vᵀ(t) |
 -------------------

3D RELATIONS: when axis of rotation is about arbitary axis
 ----------------------
| vᵀ(t) = w(t) X x(t)  |    
| aᶜ(t) = w(t) X vᵀ(t) |
 ----------------------

where ŵ,v̂,âᶜ make up the basis at point P 
Point P rotates around an axis with center Or
x(t) is the radius vector from Or to point P
w(t) = sŵ where s = Speed (radians per sec)

=============================================================================
POINT FIXED TO A ROTATING BODY
=============================================================================
change in body's orientation

A force F is applied to Point P on an object which results in a torque
that rotates the whole body's orientation around the axis R X F
with an angular accerlation α
