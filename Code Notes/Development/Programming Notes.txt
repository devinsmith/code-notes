VALUE TYPES: have automatic storage, stored on stack/register
REFERENCE TYPES: have dynamic storage, stored on heap, accessed through references/pointers
STATIC TYPES: have static storage, stored in fixed seperate memory/data segment
OBJECTS: Instances of a class
POD TYPES: primitive variables, pointers, unions, arrays of POD types, structs/classes of POD types

LOCAL SCOPE: Variable defined in a block
GLOBAL SCOPE: Variable defined outside a block, can be in a namespace
CLASS SCOPE: Member Variables in a class
FUNCTION PROTOTYPE SCOPE: Variables in function prototype
PUBLIC/EXTERNAL LINKAGE: Can be accessed accross files
PRIVATE/INTERNAL LINKAGE: Can only be accessed by file declared in

UNARY OPERATOR: Act on single values
BINARY OPERATOR: Act on two values
TERNARY OPERATOR: Act on three values

DEEP COPY: Underlying memory the reference/pointer points to is copied
SHALLOW COPY: Reference/pointer is copied and points to original data

DECLARING VARIABLES
• Determines how much memory is needed for a data object
• Determines how the bits in memory are interpreted 
• Determines what methods can be performed using the data object
• Statically typed languages require variable type to be defined

NAMING CONVENTION
• Characters usable: alphabet, numbers, underscore character
• The first character in a name cannot be a numeric digit.
• You can’t use a keyword for a name.
• Names beginning with __ or _ are reserved for use by the compiler
• Camel notation: myVariable
• Pascal notation: MyVariable

TYPE-SAFETY
• How much compiler will check that you don't mix incompatible variables
• Eg. C++ prevents floating point being added to string

TYPE-CAST / EXPLICIT CONVERSION
• Data may be lost, done by user with cast operator
• base -> derived
• double -> float -> long -> int -> short
• unsigned -> signed

AUTOMATIC / IMPLICIT CONVERSION
• Bool is converted to int internally
• No data is lost, auto done by compiler
• Can interfere with overload resolution and silently let incorrect code compile
• derived -> base
• short -> int -> long -> float -> double
• signed -> unsigned

OPERATORS / ESCAPED CHARACTERS
::   Scope resolution operator
\n   Newline
\t   Horizontal tab
\b   Backspace
\\   Backslash
\'   Single quote
\"   Double quote
\r   Return
\0   Null character

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
\w{2}      2 letters
\s*        Arbitrary number of spaces
\d{5}      5 digits
//.*?\n    All between // and \n
//.*?$     All between // and end

ORDER OF EXPRESSION EVALUATION
• Known as short-circuiting logical expressions
• Order is left to right where right is only done if left is true: if(left && right)
• Doesn't work with bitwise operators

CHARACTER ENCODING
• ASCII Represents English characters as numbers from 0 to 127 in 1 byte
• UTF-8 (Unicode) backward compatibly with ASCII and use 1 byte- other characters require 2-4 bytes
• UTF-16 (Unicode) better when not using ASCII- can represent some characters with less memory than UTF-8

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//PROGRAM EXECUTION
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) PREPROCESSOR
• Accepts Source code, Outputs Source code
• Removes comments and # directives

2) COMPILER
• Accepts Source code, Outputs machine/assembly/object code
• Mangles C++ function names as it has function overloading
  using extern "C" or compiling in C will prevent the mangling

3) LINKER
• Accepts machine code, Outputs machine code in form of executable
• Links together your code with any external libraries

COMPILE TIME: Action performed during compilation; uses no execution time.
RUN TIME: Action performed during program execution

OPCODE: single executable machine language instruction
OPERANDS: arguments given after the opcode
MNEMONICS: set to equal an opcode or a series of opcodes/operands
ENDIAN-NESS: Ordering of bytes in memory of a data object

LITTLE ENDIAN (BACKWARDS)
• multi-byte values are written least significant byte first
• used by x86 architecture
• 0x12345678 is written in memory as 78 56 34 12    

BIG ENDIAN (FORWARDS)
• multi-byte values are written most significant byte first
• 0x12345678 is written in memory as 12 34 56 78

===============================================================================
RAM MEMORY LOCATIONS
===============================================================================

RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM)
• Physical Main memory where everything is held for execution
• Virtual memory is memory on hard drive extending RAM

SEGMENTS 
• Sections of memory used for various purposes
• Segmentation Fault: Attempt to access RAM location that the CPU cannot physically access

INITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (GLOBAL/STATIC)
• Contains global/static values that have storage allocated at startup

INITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (CONST DATA)
• Contains const data and string literals whose values are known at compile time
• All data read-only and modifying it is undefined behaviour due to optimizations

UNINITIALIZED DATA SEGMENT (BSS)
• Contains zero-initialised data

THE STACK
• LIFO Segment storing temporary/local/value-type variables and keeps track of program execution
• Each function called has a 'Stack Frame' containing local variables until the function returns
• Contains memory address of next instruction to execute after the called function returns
• Self manages memory; variables allocated and freed automatically, no fragmentation
• Has limit on size, Fast access
• Operations on objects are usually faster

THE HEAP
• Segment storing dynamically allocated reference-type variables
• User allocates memory; memory may become fragmented
• Larger size than stack though slower as it uses pointers to access
• Doesn't actually use a heap structure, can be based off queue
• Operations on objects are usually slower
• Heap used by malloc/free and placement new, Free store used by new/delete
• Free Store may be the Heap or a seperated area so new/delete and malloc/free can't be interchanged

===============================================================================
CPU MEMORY LOCATIONS
===============================================================================

REGISTERS
• Physical Temporary storage for processing data/calculations taken from cache
• ESP: STACK POINTER REGISTER: Always points to the top of the stack
• EBP: STACK BASE POINTER REGISTER: Pointer to data on the stack. 
• EAX: ACCUMULATOR REGISTER: Primarly used for mathematical operations
• EBX: BASE REGISTER: Pointer to data in a segment register
• ECX: COUNTER REGISTER: Counter for string and loop operations
• EDX: DATA REGISTER: Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations
• ESI: SOURCE REGISTER: Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations
• EDI: DESTINATION REGISTER: Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations
• FLAGS REGISTER: Reports on the status of the program being executed
• IP (INTRUCTION POINTER) REGISTER: Contains a pointer to the next intruction to be executed

CACHES
• Physical Temporary storage for frequently accessed data for rapid access, sends to registers
• No processing on data- must be moved to registers if this is needed
• Cache Miss: Failed attempt to read/write to the cache resulting in RAM access

===============================================================================
VISUAL STUDIO DEBUG MEMORY ALLOCATION
===============================================================================

• Debug uses more memory than release to store guard bytes/information about allocated memory
• Guard bytes are used to detect buffer overruns/underruns
• Freed memory is set to 0xDD (Dead Memory) to detect dangling pointers
• Newly allocated memory is set to 0xCD (Clean Memory) to determine uninitalised variables

0xABABABAB : Guard bytes used by HeapAlloc() after allocated heap memory
0xFDFDFDFD : Guard bytes used by C++ Debugging Heap before and after allocated heap memory
0xFEEEFEEE : Freed heap memory used by HeapFree()
0xDDDDDDDD : Freed heap memory
0xCCCCCCCC : Uninitialised stack memory, used by C++ debugging runtime library
0xCDCDCDCD : Uninitialised heap memory, used by C++ debugging runtime library
0xBAADF00D : Uninitialised heap memory, used by LocalAlloc(LMEM_FIXED)
0xABADCAFE : A startup to this value to initialize all free memory to catch errant pointers
0xBADCAB1E : Error Code returned to the debugger when connection is severed to the debugger
0xBEEFCACE : Used by NET as a magic number in resource files
0xDEADDEAD : Microsoft Windows STOP Error code used when the user manually initiates the crash
0xc0000005 : Exception Code Access Violation, accessing an null pointer

INVARIANCE: Allows neither

IS-A RELATIONSHIP
• Class inherits an interface + implementation for non pure virtual functions
• Public inheritance

HAS-A RELATIONSHIP
• Class acquires implementation without the interface 
• Interface can still be used within class methods, but not outside class
• Containment/Composition/Layering, Private/Protected inheritance

===============================================================================
POLYMORPHISM
===============================================================================
AD-HOC POLYMORPHISM: object types are explicitly defined for overloading
PARAMETRIC POLYMORPHISM: object types aren't defined, any object can be used

1) PREPROCESSING (AD-HOC/PARAMETRIC)
   #define f(int x) ((x) += 2)
   #define f(double x) ((x) += 2)
   #define f(X) ((X) += 2)

2) OVERLOADING (AD-HOC)
   void f(int& x)    { x += 2; }
   void f(double& x) { x += 2; }

3) TEMPLATES (PARAMETRIC)
   template <typename T>
   void f(T& x) { x += 2; }

4) VIRTUAL METHODS (AD-HOC)
   BaseClass* pBase = &derivedObject;
   pBase->MyVirtualFunction();

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//BIT MANIPULATION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

BYTE: 8 bits
WORD: 2 bytes
DOUBLE WORD: 2 words
QUAD WORD: 2 double words
RADIX: Number base for a counting system (Decimal:10, Binary:2)

STRUCTURE OF A BYTE
Most values a byte can have: 0 -> (128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1) = 0 -> 255 = 256
 2⁷  2⁶  2⁵  2⁴  2³  2²  2¹  2°
128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

HEXADECIMAL
1-F (1-15 where A = 10)
Two hex values = one byte
0xff = 0xffffffff = 255 = 11111111

FLOATING POINT PRECISION: Binary cannot express some floating point values (0.1) exactly
COUNTING IN BINARY: 0000  0001  0010  0011  0100  0101  0110  0111  1000
BINARY-TO-DECIMAL: 1101 = 1x2³ + 1x2² + 0x2¹ + 1x2° = 13
HEX-TO-DECIMAL: A3F = 10x16² + 3x16¹ + 15x16° = 2623
HEX-TO-BINARY: 0xC2 = binaryC binary2 = 1100 0010 = 11000010 (use image table)
BINARY-TO-HEX: 11000010 = 1100 0010 = 0xC2 (use image table)

TWOS COMPLEMENT
• Standard way of representing negative integers in binary
• −x is defined as ∼x + 1
  Start:    0001  (decimal 1)
  Invert:   1110
  Add One:  1111  (decimal -1)

BITWISE OPERATORS
• Can be used with boolean, intergers and char
• Bools are converted to ints holding true: 0x00000001, 0001, 1 and false: 0x00000000, 0000, 0

~     bitwise NOT    Returns all bits flipped
|     bitwise OR     Returns 1/true if either or both are 1/true
&     bitwise AND    Returns 1/true if both are 1/true
^     bitwise XOR    Returns 1/true if either but not both are 1/true
<<    left shift     Moves all bits to the left, drops the last 0 or 1 and adds 0 to the start
>>    right shift    Moves all bits to the right, drops the first 0 or 1 and adds 0 to the end

USING  WITH BITS
Flipping bits:     ~00000011 = 11111100
Checking bits on:  if 00000011 & 00000010 == 00000010 then on
Turning bits on:   00000011 | 00000100 = 00000111 turning bit 2 on
Turning bits off:  00000011 & 11111101 = 00000001 turning bit 1 off
Toggling bits:     00000011 ^ 00000001 = 00000010 and back to 000000011 if called again
Shifting left:     10000011 << 3 = 00011000 (new values may not be zeroed)
Shifting right:    10000011 >> 3 = 00010000 (new values may not be zeroed)

USING WITH VALUES/MASKS 
Adding two masks: value = MASK1 | MASK2 
Turn off a mask:  value &= ~MASK1
Add a mask:       value |= MASK1
Test if masked:   if value & MASK1 == MASK1 then has mask
Multiply by 2ˣ:   value <<= 3 is same as value *= 2³
Divide by 2ˣ:     value >>= 3 is same as value /= 2³

BITWISE WITH BOOL
bool ifBothAreTrue   = myBool1 & myBool2    Both are true
bool ifEitherAreTrue = myBool1 | myBool2    Either are true
bool ifEitherAreTrue = myBool1 ^ myBool2    Either are true but not both
bool success = true; 
success &= HasSucceeded();                  Will lock in false if something fails

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//ERROR HANDLING/EXCEPTIONS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) THROW BY VALUE
• When exception is thrown, copy of thrown variable is made as it needs it after function out of scope

2) STACK UNWINDS
• Stack releases memory until reaching the corresponding try-catch block
• Any destructors are called on way as objects go out of scope
• Local pointers are destroyed without calling delete

3) CATCH BY CONST REFERENCE
• Const is used to prevent the exception from being modified and giving incorrect crash information
• Reference is used so the exception can be resolved polymorphically and so slicing does not happen
• Reference is used instead of pointer to reduce the need to manage any memory at the catch position
• Allocating memory for an exception through a pointer may not work if the exception is out of memory

EXCEPTION SAFETY
• Use RAII to auto cleanup resources if exception is thrown
• Only change state once any possible errors have been resolved
• Destructor/deallocation/swap functions should never throw as impossible to safely cleanup

EXCEPTION NEUTRAL
• Exceptions thrown should be propagated unchanged to the objects's caller

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: BASIC
• Failures/exceptions might alter program state
• No leaks occur and affected objects are still usable but not in predictable state

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: STRONG
• Failures/exceptions guarantee program state is unchanged
• No leaks occur and objects and iterators not affected

ABRAHAMS GUARANTEE: NOTHROW
• Failure and exceptions do not happen

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//NETWORKING
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NETWORK: Requires common language (protocol) and link (wireless or physical)
ROUTER: Directs network traffic along the correct route
CLIENT: Computer that initiates an exchange between another computer, connects only when required
SERVER: Computer that receives the connection from another computer, runs continuous listening program

TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL): Packets guaranteed, delivered in order, slower
UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL): Not guaranteed, may not arrive in order, faster
LATENCY: Time taken for packets to travel from the client -> server -> client, measured by ping
